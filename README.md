## Introduction

Welcome to [@evanboyd31](https://github.com/evanboyd31)'s NHL Game Prediction Website! This website was created from two of my biggest passions: Hockey and Software Engineering. The goal of this website is to provide insightful and accurate predictions for winners of upcoming NHL games, as determined by a custom `scikit-learn` Random Forest machine learning model. Feel free to explore the website and check out the predictions for today's NHL games.
